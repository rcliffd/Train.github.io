# Train.github.io
Train Sch.
I am to build a responsive site using the knowledge we have learned and integrating our site with the Firebase Database site.
I have used HTML, Bootstrap and Javascript.
At the moment I am having issues getting the train sch to respond with my data base, I am also having issues with the trains being stored in my train log container. Also I am coming up with a broken link for a picture I was trying to use.
